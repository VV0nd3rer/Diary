### How to deploy
1.  Prepeare you local database:
     * Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Optionally, you can download and install [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) which is an administration and development platform for PostgreSQL.
     * Clone or download application database backup file form here https://github.com/kverchi/diary-db-backup.git
     * Create the database with name *diary*
     * Restore postgresql backup file *diary-v1.0.tar* on your local Postgresql server for newly created database *diary*. [How to restore backup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/backup-dump.html#BACKUP-DUMP-RESTORE) 
     * Set database credentials for connection to your database. 
     
     There are 2 ways to set database credentials into application's properties file: as a *plain text* or as an *encrypted values*
     
     Set credentials as a *plain text*:
     * Open *<path-to-app>/src/main/resources/properties/local/app.properties* and set your database username and password to JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME and JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD properties.
     
     Set credentials as an *encrypted values* with Jasypt encryption tool:
     * Download and install [Jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org/download.html)
     * Set Jasypt enctiption key as local environment variable DIARY_PASS_VAR. [How to set environment variable in Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) and [how to set environment variable in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/set-path-variable-linux-permanently/).
     * Encrypt your database username and password with your environment variable. [How to encrypt with Jasypt](https://apereo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASUM/pages/103261428/HOWTO+Use+Jasypt+to+encrypt+passwords+in+configuration+files)
     * Open *<path-to-app>/src/main/resources/properties/local/app.properties* and set your encrypted username and encrypted password to JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME and JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD properties
     
2. Build war file with Maven: open a terminal, go to the root of your local project and execute `mvn package`. [How to install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
3. Deploy war file at your local **Tomcat Root**. [How to deploy war file](http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=123229)
